# Tranding-News-Alert-Project-Python
This is the news alert project that will send sms to your number. It will make you aware about the stock price for specific comapny that you looking for.

## What I've done in this project?
I used to fetch the price for the *TSLA(Tesla)* company, It will compare the currect day *market open price* price with the previous day *market closed price*. If the price is higher than 2%, then it will send formated message accordingly. Then it will also fetch the first two or three artical and send the Headline, brief and url with the message.
I used to send the no. of message according to the no. of articals.
